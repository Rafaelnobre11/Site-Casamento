## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Terracotta (#e85d3f) for CTAs, prominent icons, and links, providing a vibrant and modern touch.
- Background color: Off-white (#fff8f6) and pure white (#ffffff) to ensure ample visual space and cleanliness.
- Text color: Charcoal gray (#111827) for high-contrast headings and medium gray (#4b5563) for paragraphs, ensuring readability.
- Headings: 'Playfair' for classic and elegant headings.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif geometric and clean typography for excellent readability.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use an airy layout with generous whitespace and centralized containers (max-width) to prevent content stretching on ultra-wide screens.
- Implement subtle 'Fade In Up' animations for text elements upon loading and confetti animations upon PIX confirmation, providing delightful user feedback.
